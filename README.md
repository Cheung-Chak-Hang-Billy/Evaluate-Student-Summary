Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. You'll build a model that evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary. You'll have access to a collection of real student summaries to train your model.

This project will assist teachers in evaluating the quality of student work and also help learning platforms provide immediate feedback to students.
