## Evaluate Student Summaries
Automatically assess summaries written by students in grades 3-12
### Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. The model builds to evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary. 

This project will assist teachers in evaluating the quality of student work and also help learning platforms provide immediate feedback to students.

### Context
Summary writing is an important skill for learners of all ages. Summarization enhances reading comprehension, particularly among second language learners and students with learning disabilities. Summary writing also promotes critical thinking, and itâ€™s one of the most effective ways to improve writing abilities. However, students rarely have enough opportunities to practice this skill, as evaluating and providing feedback on summaries can be a time-intensive process for teachers. Innovative technology like large language models (LLMs) could help change this, as teachers could employ these solutions to assess summaries quickly.

There have been advancements in the automated evaluation of student writing, including automated scoring for argumentative or narrative writing. However, these existing techniques don't translate well to summary writing. Evaluating summaries introduces an added layer of complexity, where models must consider both the student writing and a single, longer source text. Although there are a handful of current techniques for summary evaluation, these models have often focused on assessing automatically-generated summaries rather than real student writing, as there has historically been a lack of these types of datasets.
